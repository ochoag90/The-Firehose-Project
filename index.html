			I am a Mechanical Engineer, graduatedraduated from WIT in Boston, MA. I have 5 years of experience on the field of manufacturing. My specialty is mold design, cnc programming, FEA analysis, data analytics, and marketing. I have many hobbies, which mostly consist of physical activities. I love to snowboard in the Northeast, ride my bike for long distances, rock climb with friends, and push myself to exhaustion. I love pushing through the mental and physical aspects I face when I do any of these activities. It helps me feel more aware of myself and my surroundings, giving myself a deep look into the mechanics of the activity I am doing. This in turn helps me improve.
